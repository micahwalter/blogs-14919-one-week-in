# One week in

Day 14,919

It's Sunday evening. I've just spent the last few hours at friends, watching football. There is absolutely no way I'm going to sit here and write a lengthy weekly, Sunday blog post.

But, now I have this #100words thing going. So, I have an out. I have the option to give you 100 words about whatever I want. I'm already up to 68. 

The longer posts are coming, I promise, but not tonight. Tonight I'm tired and cranky, and it's now time for me to settle in, watch some TV, and drift away.

Tomorrow is tomorrow.
